# 📰 FlipItNews - News Category Classification with NLP and Machine Learning

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for **multi-class text classification** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The goal is to classify news articles into predefined categories based on their content.

## 📌 Overview

- **Dataset**: Custom dataset containing news articles and their corresponding categories.
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and contraction expansion.
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words (BoW).
- **Models Trained**:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Random Forest
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-Score (Macro), Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix.
- **Visualization**: Model performance comparison using bar charts.

## 🧠 Project Workflow

1. **Install Dependencies**

- pip install -r requirements.txt


2. **Load and Explore Dataset**

- Load `flipitnews-data.csv`
- Explore category distribution and sample articles

3. **Text Preprocessing**

- Convert to lowercase
- Expand contractions
- Remove non-letter characters
- Tokenize, remove stopwords, and lemmatize

4. **Feature Engineering**

- Use `TF-IDF` or `CountVectorizer` to convert text to numerical features

5. **Model Training & Evaluation**

- Train four classifiers
- Evaluate using:
  - Accuracy
  - F1-Score (Macro)
  - Classification Report
  - Confusion Matrix

6. **Results Visualization**

- Comparing models visually based on accuracy
